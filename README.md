## Installation & Setup Guide

## Docker Deployment

This project is containerized using Docker Compose for simplified deployment and environment consistency. The setup includes three services:
- Frontend (React) - runs on port 3001
- Backend (Node.js/Express) - runs on port 8080
- Database (PostgreSQL) - runs internally on port 5432

### Prerequisites
- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd "Fi Money"
   ```

2. **Start the application with Docker Compose**:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
   This will:
   - Build the frontend and backend Docker images
   - Start the PostgreSQL database
   - Start the backend service
   - Start the frontend service

3. **Access the application**:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3001
   - Backend API: http://localhost:8080
   - Database: PostgreSQL running in a container (port 5432 internally)

### Stopping the Application
To stop all services:
```bash
docker compose down
```

### Environment Variables
All necessary environment variables are already configured in the `docker-compose.yaml` file. You can modify them there if needed.

### 1. Obtain the Source Code

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd "Fi Money" # Move into the project root
```

### 2. Backend Environment Configuration

1.  **Change directory:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  **Install server dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory (you can copy `.env.example`).
    ```env
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>?sslmode=require
    JWT_SECRET=your_super_secure_jwt_secret_key
    PORT=8080
    ```
    _Important:_ Replace `DATABASE_URL` with your specific PostgreSQL connection string. Ensure `JWT_SECRET` is a strong, unique value.
4.  **Initialize Database Schema:**
    **Warning:** This operation will clear and re-create your `users` and `products` tables. Backup any crucial data if this isn't a fresh setup.
    ```bash
    npm run init-db
    ```
    This action ensures the `products` table includes the `times_added` column for analytics.
5.  **Start the Backend Service:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    # Alternatively:
    node src/app.js
    ```
    The backend API will become available at `http://localhost:8080`.

### 3. Frontend Environment Configuration

1.  **Change directory:**
    (From the project root, navigate back into `frontend`)
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2.  **Install client dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Launch Frontend Server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The React application should open in your browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000`.

**To test the full application flow:**

1.  **Register a new user:** Through the frontend UI, create a new user account.
2.  **Log in:** Use the newly registered user's credentials (or an existing one) to log in via the frontend.
3.  **Add a product:** From the product list page, add a new product.
4.  **View products:** Verify that the product list updates and displays the newly added product.

## Database Schema Overview

Our application is structured around these key PostgreSQL tables:

### Users (Authentication)

- `id` (Primary Key, Auto-increment)
- `username` (Unique, Not Null)
- `password_hash` (Stores bcrypt hashed passwords, Not Null)

### Products (Inventory Items)

- `id` (Primary Key, Auto-increment)
- `name` (Not Null)
- `type` (Not Null)
- `sku` (Unique identifier, Not Null)
- `image_url` (Optional)
- `description` (Optional)
- `quantity` (Integer, Not Null)
- `price` (Numeric(10,2), Not Null)
- `times_added` (Integer, Default 0; for analytics on product additions)

## API Endpoint Reference

All API services are available at `http://localhost:8080`. For comprehensive details on request/response formats, parameters, and authentication, please consult the `API_DOCUMENTATION.md` file.

### Identity & Security Endpoints

- **POST** `/register` - New user account creation
- **POST** `/login` - User authentication and JWT issuance

### Inventory Operations Endpoints

- **POST** `/products` - Add a new product (or increment count if SKU exists)
- **GET** `/products` - Retrieve list of products (with pagination)
- **PUT** `/products/{id}/quantity` - Update specific product quantity
- **DELETE** `/products/{id}` - Remove a product

### Analytics & Data Insights

- **GET** `/products/analytics/most-added` - Fetch data on most frequently added products

---

## Authentication Process Details

1.  **Account Creation:** Users register via the `/register` endpoint.
2.  **Token Acquisition:** A successful login (`POST` to `/login`) provides a JWT, crucial for authenticated requests.
3.  **Authorized Requests:** This JWT must be included in the `Authorization` header (`Bearer <token>`) for all protected API calls.
4.  **Token Validity:** JWTs are valid for 24 hours; re-login is necessary upon expiration.

## Security Implementation

- **Password Safeguarding:** User passwords are encrypted using bcrypt before being stored, significantly enhancing security.
- **JWT Access Control:** Critical API routes are meticulously protected with JWTs, ensuring only validated and authorized users can interact with them.
- **Input Integrity Validation:** A robust validation system actively scrutinizes all incoming data for API requests, preventing malformed inputs and thwarting potential injection vulnerabilities.
- **Environmental Isolation:** Sensitive configuration data, such as database credentials and cryptographic keys, are strictly segregated via environment variables, eliminating their exposure in the source code.

## Future Enhancements & Expansion Ideas

Potential areas for evolving this project include:

- **Advanced Reporting Modules:** Developing more sophisticated analytics, such as identifying least-performing products, revenue breakdown by product type, or trend analysis for sales over time.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implementing distinct user roles with fine-grained permissions (e.g., read-only users, inventory managers, administrators).
- **Dynamic Search & Filtering:** Introducing powerful search capabilities and flexible filtering options for the product catalog to enhance data discovery and user experience.
- **Optimized Product Listing:** Implementing server-side pagination for the product display to ensure efficient handling and faster loading times for very large datasets.
- **Integrated Image Uploads:** Developing functionality for direct image uploads to a cloud storage service (e.g., AWS S3, Cloudinary), moving beyond URL-based inputs.
- **Real-time Interactions:** Leveraging WebSocket technology to enable instant updates across all connected client applications for inventory changes or new product additions.
- **Thorough Testing Suites:** Expanding comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for both frontend and backend to guarantee high reliability, stability, and bug prevention.
- **Centralized Logging & Monitoring:** Establishing a robust logging infrastructure to monitor application behavior, track errors, and streamline debugging in production environments.
- **Advanced Frontend State Management:** For growing application complexity, consider adopting a dedicated state management library (e.g., Redux, Zustand) for more predictable and maintainable frontend state.
